; extensions.conf - the Asterisk dial plan
;
; Static extension configuration file, used by
; the pbx_config module. This is where you configure all your
; inbound and outbound calls in Asterisk.
;
; This configuration file is reloaded
; - With the "dialplan reload" command in the CLI
; - With the "reload" command (that reloads everything) in the CLI

;
; The "General" category is for certain variables.
;
[general]
;
; If static is set to no, or omitted, then the pbx_config will rewrite
; this file when extensions are modified.  Remember that all comments
; made in the file will be lost when that happens.

; if static=yes and writeprotect=no, you can save dialplan by
; CLI command "dialplan save" too

writeprotect=no
;
; If autofallthrough is set, then if an extension runs out of
; things to do, it will terminate the call with BUSY, CONGESTION
; or HANGUP depending on Asterisk's best guess. This is the default.
;
; If autofallthrough is not set, then if an extension runs out of
; things to do, Asterisk will wait for a new extension to be dialed
; (this is the original behavior of Asterisk 1.0 and earlier).
